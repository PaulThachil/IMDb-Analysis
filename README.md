In this project, I analyze data from various sources to understand key trends in a specific industry over a multi-year period. Using a combination of data scraping, cleaning, and integration techniques in R, I merge information from different datasets to create a comprehensive overview of key metrics. The final analysis provides valuable insights into industry performance, highlighting trends and patterns in critical factors like revenue, ratings, and other important indicators.

## What did I learn?

In this project, I developed several new skills that enhanced my data analysis capabilities. One of the key skills I acquired was web scraping using R, where I learned to extract and parse data from online sources with tools like rvest. This required a deep understanding of HTML structures and techniques to navigate web pages, identify relevant data, and convert it into a format suitable for analysis.

Additionally, I honed my data cleaning and transformation skills. This involved handling irregular or inconsistent data, such as converting textual representations of numbers into numeric values, addressing missing data, and renaming columns for consistency. The project also improved my ability to integrate multiple datasets, ensuring data accuracy and completeness while providing a solid foundation for further analysis and insights.
